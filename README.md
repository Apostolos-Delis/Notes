# Notes

This contains a directory of all my markdown notes for different classes.
* Every directory containing notes contains an images directory, which is where all the images 
for that class our stored, as well as a Makefile, which uses [Ghostscript](ghostscript.com) to 
package together all the markdown files into a pdf. 

* All these notes where taken using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) with
[vim-instant-markdown](https://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown)
