### Chapter 1 - Introduction (Database System Concepts)


#### Database Management Systems

1. DBMS contain information about a particular enterprise
    * Contains collection of data and an api to access them
2. Drawbacks of file systems for storing data
    * Data redundancy - multiple file formats, duplication in different files
    * Difficulty query needs its own program
    * Data Isolation - caused by multiple files and formats
    * Integrity Problem
        * Constraints are buried under program code
        * Hard to add new constraints or change existing ones
    * Atomicy of Updates
        * Failures may leave database inconsistent
        * Concurrent access by multiple users can be very problematic
            due to lack of protections
    * Security Problems - Hard to provide users access to some data but not all
3. Levels of Abstraction
    1. Physical Level: describes how record is stored
    2. Logical Level: describes data stored in database, and relationships among data
    3. View Level: application programs hide details of data types.

4. Instances and Schema
    * Logical Schema - The overall architecture
    * Physical Schema - The overall physical structure of the database
    * Instance - Actual content of database at a certain point in time
    * Physical Data Dependence - Ability to modify physical schema without
        changing the logical schema
5. Relational Model
    * All the data is stored in various tables
    * Can form relationships between the different tables and create mappings with them
6. Data Definition Language (DDL)
    * Specific notation for defining the database schema
    * Example in SQL:

        ```sql
        create table instructor(
                ID              char(5),
                name            varchar(20),
                dept_name       varchar(20),
                salary          numeric(8,2)
        )
        ```
    * DDL compiler generates a set of table templates stored in a data dictionary
    * Data dictionary contains metadata such as database schema and integrity constraints
7. SQL
    * Most widely used commercial language for DDL
    * SQL is **NOT** a Turing machine equivalent language
    * To compute higher-order functions, SQL is usually embedded into another language
8. Database Design
    * Logical Design - Deciding on the database schema.
    * Physical Design - Deciding on the physical layout of memory for the database
9. XML: Extensible Markup Language
    * Originally intended as a markup language not a database language.
    * The ability to specify tags and create nested structures made XML great for exchanging data
    * XML for a while was the go-to method for transferring data across the web, (JSON is better)
10. Storage Management
    * **Storage Manager** is a program module that provides the interface between low-level data
        and the application programs and queries submitted to the system.
    * The storage manager is responsible to the following tasks:
        * Interaction with OS file manager
        * Efficient storing, retrieving, and updating data
    * Some of its issues is with storage access, file organization, and indexing/hashing
11. Query Processing
    * Alternative ways of evaluating a given query
        * Will look for equivalent expressions
        * Different algorithms for each expression
    * The differences between good and bad ways of evaluating expressions can be huge

12. Transaction Management
    * A **transaction** is a collection of operations that performs a single logical function
    * A **Transaction-Management component** ensures the database remains consistent despite
        system failures like power outages
    * **Concurrency-controll manage** controls the interaction among concurrent transactions

13. Database System Internals:
    * The Database essentially abstracts away all the need for application developers and users
        to know how the data is structured, that is all handled by the query processor.

### Chapter  - Introduction to the Relational Model (Database System Concepts)

1. Attribute Types
    * **Domain**: The set of allowed values for each attribute
    * Attribute values are (normally) atomic.
    * The value `null` is an element of every domain.
2. Relation Schema and Instance
    * The current values (relation instance) of a relation are specified by a table.
    * An element t of r is a tuple, represented by a row of a table.
    * If
        \begin{equation*}
        A_1, A_2, ... , A_n
        \end{equation*}
        are attributes, then
        \begin{equation*}
        R = (A_1, A_2, ... , A_n)
        \end{equation*}
        is a relation
    * So a relation is a set of n-tuples
    * **Note**: relations are ordered
3. Keys
    * K is a **Superkey** of R if values for K are sufficient to identify a unique tuple of
        relation r(R)
    * Superkey K is a **Candidate Key** if K is minimal
    * Foreign key constraint: Value of one relation must appear in another
4. Joining 2 Relations - Natural Join
    * The natural join of relations R and S is a relation on schema RxS obtained as follows:
        * If an element of R and an element of S have the same attributes, add it to the result
5. Notes about Relational Languages
    * Each Query input is a table
    * Each Query output is a table
    * All data in the output table appears in one of the input tables
    * Relational Algebra is not Turing Complete

### Chapter 2 - Data Models and Query Languages (Designing Data Intensive Applications)

Kleppmann: Read pages 27-45 for the bigger picture

1. Relational Model Versus Document Model
    * Relational model is much faster, uses less memory, and just in general, can
        handle large queries better than a flat file system
2. Birth of NoSQL
    * Latest competitor to the relational model
    * Main driving forces are:
        * Need for greater scalability of relational databases
        * Specialized queries not supported well by relational model
        * Frustration caused by the restrictions of the relational database model
3. The Object-Relational Mismatch
    * Most code done today in the application layer is object oriented with imperative languages
        * This draws criticism from people since SQL is not
    * Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks attempt to reduce the amount of transitional
        layer code people have to write.
    * Commonly support formats for SQL are JSON and XML.
        * Many file databases such as MongoDB use JSON internally to store data
            * **Note**: technically MongoDB uses a binary form of JSON called BSON
        * The JSON representation has better locality and supports one to many relations with
            a tree structure.
4. Many-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships
    * Benefits to storing IDs rather than strings:
        * Consistent style and spelling across profiles
        * No ambiguity
        * Ease of updating (all in one place)
        * Localization support
        * Better Search
        * Takes up less memory (numbers take less memory than long strings)
    * With relational databases, the use of an ID allows for very easy joins that are
        simply not often available easily in document databases
    * If the database uses many-to-many relationships, it becomes much less appealing
        to use a document based model
5. Query Languages for Data
    * SQL is a declarative language that is different from other imperative alternatives.
    * Ex: you want to return only the sharks fromt the list in an imperative language:

        ```node
        function getSharks() {
            var sharks = [];
            for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
                if (animals[i].family === "Sharks") {
                sharks.push(animals[i]);
                }
            }
            return sharks;
        }
        ```
    * In relational algebra, this would be:
        \begin{equation}
        sharks = \sigma_\mathrm{family}= {}_\mathrm{"Sharks"}(animals)
        \end{equation}
    * SQL follows the relational algebra model:

        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM animals WHERE family = 'Sharks';
        ```
    * In a declarative query language, like SQL or relational algebra, you just specify
        the pattern of the data you wantâ€”what conditions the results must meet, and
        how you want the data to be transformed
    * However, you don't specify to the machine <u>HOW</u> that is done
    * SQL hides the details
