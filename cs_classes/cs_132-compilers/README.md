# CS 132 - Compliers

All these notes are from professor Jens Palsberg

To generate the pdfs, run the following commands (assuming you have 
ghostscript installed)

```bash
cd notes/ 
make build 
cd ..
```

You should now have a `compilers.pdf` which contains most of the important notes 
from that class, if you want to see the individual notes from each chapter, you can find
them in `notes/build`
