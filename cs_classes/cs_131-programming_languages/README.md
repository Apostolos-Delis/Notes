# CS 131 - Programming Languages

All these notes are from professor Paul Eggert's lectures.

To generate the pdfs, run the following commands (assuming you have 
ghostscript installed)

```bash
cd notes/ 
make build 
cd ..
```

You should now have a `readings.pdf` which contains most of the important notes 
from that class, if you want the other notes, there is also
`notes/programming_languages.pdf`
