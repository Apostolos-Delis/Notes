Based on the Ycombinators course found [here](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/)

#### 4 Main Ideas for a successfull startup:
Idea, Product, Team, Execution

1. Idea:
    * Idea is no always as that important, but a bad idea is still bad
    * Most good companies have better ideas 
    * Always start with the idea, wait until you have a good idea
    * Startups are typically mission-oriented
    * Typically takes a decade to start a successful startup
    * Truly good ideas aren't worth stealing because they don't actually sound good
        * Something that sounds good but actually isn't 
    * You cannot create a market that doesn't exist, the market has to exist and grow fast
    * Startup should be answer the question, why now?
        > Must find a market and then find an idea
2. Product 
    * Build a good product is the most important thing to do for a startup
    * Build something that a small number of users love

    * If you don't have organic growth they have 
    * Most startups do not die off because of their competition, they die from poor management
    * Do something simple and do it very well
    * Founders should have very high attention to details and have some level of fanaticism
    * Listen to outside users that will tell you exactly what they want
    * Must create a feedback loop that is as fast and efficient as possible
    * Companies should not rush to hire sales people right away, successful startup cofounders
      wil be able to market for themselves because they believe in the product
    * Metrics: Focus on growth (Indicator of a great product)
