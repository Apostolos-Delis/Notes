## Lecture 2 - Team and Execution

#### Team 
1. Cofounders
    * Track record for cofounders is terrible if they don't know each other beforehand
    * Cofounders need to be relentless that will be tough and calm, really need technical
    cofounders
    * Software people should be starting software companies.
2. Try not to Hire
    * Stay small for as long as you possibly can
        * Airbnb spent 5 months before they hired anyone
        * Need to get people who are very dedicated and commited to the vision of the product
    * Expanding fast can lead to high burn rate and spreading resources thin too quickly
3. Get the Best People
    * Good employees want to join the rocketship, so they will wait until the startup has gained
    traction
    * Want to attract good employees by first having gained some traction without them, and to also 
    be very slow when it comes to hiring people.
    * When you are hiring, 0-25% of your time should be spent hiring.
    * Mediocre engineers do not build great companies. 
    * First 100 employees are typically found through referrals.
    * For most of the first hires made in a startup, experience doesn't matter very much, aim to get 
    people with high aptitudes
    * 3 Things to look for when hiring people:
        1. Are they smart?
        2. Do they get things done?
        3. Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?
    * Typically instead of doing an interview, work with them on a project (this is why ideal candidates 
    are candidates that you already know. 
    * Call referrals and contacts that they provide because it is a good way to get info on a candidate
    * Want people who are willing to take a risk 
    * Candidates who are good at communicating typically make great employees.
4. Equity 
    * Founders should aim to give away 10% equity away to the first ten employees.
        * Earn the equity in a vested schedule over four years
    * Be as generous with equity as possible with employees and more stingy with investors
5. You've Hired the best - Now Keep Them
    * Give constant feedback to employees
    * have one on ones to get a feel for how they are feeling with the company and the direction it is moving in.
    * Employee moral is very important
6. Fire Fast
    * Want to fire as fast as possible because they are a huge drain to the company.
    * You have to act when its clear that the employee is doing everything wrong
    * Its ok to make a mistake here and there, but if an employee is constantly doing the opposite of what 
    you would have done, its time to let them go.
    * Make sure to talk about equity with founders early on
        * Make sure that founders have vesting equity, won't get funding without this.
